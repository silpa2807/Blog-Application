            This oatmeal smoothie has a relatively short shelf-life once blended, but you can easily make your mornings less stressful by creating smoothie packs. Simply grab some zip-top bags or prep bowls with lids and add your chopped fruit and oats. Store them in the fridge for up to 1 to 2 days, or in the freezer for up to a month. When it’s time for a smoothie, dump the contents of the smoothie pack into your blender, add the liquid of your choice, and blend!
